Dance connection is how two dancers communicate and move together as one in the music.

Connection can be used to transmit power and energy as well as information and signals; some dance forms (and some dancers) primarily emphasize power or signaling, but most are probably a mixture of both. [^1]

## From ChatGPT
**3. Physical Connection: How It Feels**

I’d ask the dancers to **explore different levels of connection**:

• **Frame**: The structure between partners.

• **Tone**: The level of tension or relaxation.

• **Elasticity**: How connection can stretch or compress like a rubber band.

**4. Connection Beyond Physical Contact**

  

Connection is not just about touching hands—it also happens through:

• **Visual connection** (eye contact).

• **Musicality** (responding to the same rhythm).

• **Energy awareness** (feeling each other’s presence and intention even at a distance).

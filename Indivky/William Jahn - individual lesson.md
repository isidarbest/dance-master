## 1. Lesson [[2025-04-10]]
Posture
- often times when he is in close embrace, he is leaning back, thus leading first with his upper body and having a bit of falling feeling
Stepping
- when he goes forward, he rotates his feet together with his pelvis and that does not allow him to relax the pelvis and also make a proper step
- often he misses steps (f.e. second step in Viradinha) which disturbs the clarity and comfort. Or when he leads something faster or different timing, he is not syncing his steps with follower so it is not so precise

How I structured the lesson
1. Dancing normally on a song
2. Dance without any body shapes and headmovements 
3. Dance on slow rhythm, stepping all the time, focusing on stepping together with the follower 
4. We were correcting the posture and stepping a little bit 
5. Going just back and forward with attention on his legs, posture and going clearly 
6. Still in a slow rhythm but using also frame and further distance for leading any steps and turns. Focus on the follower steps so you always turn her in the right direction on right leg
7. Dancing regular zouk elements in the slow rhythm
8. Switching from tum čik čik to slow rhythm
	Here the problem with clarity was usually slowing down. He slowed down too late and it wasn't clear. I told him to focus on his stepping in the second step and it helped a lot. Then I showed him that it is possible to slow down like this almost anywhere where we change direction.

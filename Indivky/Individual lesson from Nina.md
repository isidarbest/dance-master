Connecting shoulder blades. Exercise when you do lifts (zvedám se za nějakou tyč nahoru) with hands and not letting shoulders getting to your ears. Keeping this feeling.

Matching the energy with your partner, then you don't have to fight in a dance. 

When she has a heavy leader, she adds energy in the shoulder blades.

The changes are showed by tension in body or shoulder blades or steps. Or by breathing in. 
> For beginners, when we want to stop, just try to bring more weight into one step, just break the pattern
> Teaching beginners to not lead all the time, just give the impulses. Is it possible? When and how?

Leaders rotate the elbows up then he cannot put shoulder up. Followers the same. When we are in the close position, follower is just trying to close the frame a little bit to create contact (to not go up with frame everytime she feels the leader do the same)

> Head movements with frame - when we have a line of joints we can be quite relaxed and don't have to connect our shoulder blades so much. But when the impulse is not going through the joints we have to connect the shoulder blades more. 

**my technique**
Try to focus on using shoulder blades for me frame
Giving more energy into tilted turns and normal turns. Focusing on making big circles and pushing into the shoulder of follower (even can have contact on the shoulder). 
In normal turns try to have the hand lower (exercise when we create a house with hands connecting on our center of forehead and then we just use the one hand.)
When I want to finish tilted turn with some head movement or controlled movement, I have to give tension already before the finish, contraction down and then lead the finish. 

Exercise when we tried to dance firstly completely without tension in shoulder blades - then we have to be ready that anything can happen - follower deals only the impulses from body and legs.
Then we tried to have a dance with keeping the tension in shoulder blades all the time (but trying to not connect biceps). Controlling every movement. It was very hard to create a flow, to not be relaxed in relaxed movements.

## General
The whole experience was amazing, I accepted the premise from the beginning - I don't want to mainly improve my technique, but get inspired from her way of dancing. First we had few dances to align a bit more. Then I asked her if she can unleash her creativity more and that I will adapt to her. I really enjoyed which ideas she had and the way she was expressing them. At any time it didn't feel enforced or disconnected, she was suggesting and when she was not suggesting I always felt her connection.
Overall I am very satisfied with the state of my dancing now and what I can create just with little time and opportunity to align together with her. 

## Questions I asked

**What do you say to followers that are bit more shy with low self esteem about her expression in a dance?**
V: First I ask if she wants to express herself in a dance (because some followers may want to just follow).
V: Then I would tell her to go to some solo dance class, to find something that she really likes and makes her body move. Which then she can try to implement in certain movements she knows from zouk. 
V: If she does not want to put so much effort into classes etc, I give her some exercises that she can do in a dance. For example chose one part of a body that she should try to express with. 

## Comments to my dance
When I dance to fast music or very dynamic music, I tend to give less space (which is understandable because there is less space and time). Also tension in my frame gets bigger and it is harder to recognize some dynamics because I don't make such a contrast before starting some change. 
She did not feel I would lead too strong even when we tried to add some more dynamics in the dance.
After tilted turn, if I want to make some change and lead some transition, I should start changing the tension in the frame when F is already on her left leg (I already see her chest), so sooner. (the same was saying [[Individual lesson from Nina]]). Also she was correcting me that if I let the F hand closer to her chest (so she can have a bend frame) it will be easier for her to engage.

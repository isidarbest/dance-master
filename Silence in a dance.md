Music is comprised from moments of sound and absence of sound - silence.

Silence in a dance means having minimum tension in your body your need to be able to communicate with your partner. That tension in your body is also influenced by your calmness of mind.

Silence in a dance and in a couple is not happening when we are distracted and disconnected from our partner. It is the same feeling as when you are falling asleep hugging with your partner in bed.

What thoughts inside of **leader's head** are often causing tension (and getting us out of the [[Present moment|present moment]]):
- I am boring / I have to make some exciting things to entertain my partner
- I am not good enough to express this music
- I am dancing too basic things

What thoughts inside of **follower's head** are often causing tension (and getting us out of the [[Present moment|present moment]]):
- I understand it wrongly and disrupted the dance
- I make too many mistakes
- I am not following precisely
- I am not giving him good enough technique/ I am not good enough for him

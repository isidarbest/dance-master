[[My dance philosophy]]


**Also we can imagine that the steps are single piano keys. When we push multiple keys, it creates a chord - that is for us a dance element (like [[Basic step]]). But the single element can have many variations like chords, we can add some more steps or slightly change the ones we use. We can play very strong or very silent. After every chord there is a number of other chords that fit in (not infinity options). Some that are very elegant, some that are a bit harder to understand and some very unusually progressions. [^6]**

If you wait to hear the beat to start to dance, you will always be late [^6]

Leaders need flexible mind and flexible body to be able to react  ([[Xandy Liberato]] on [[2022-04 Zouk Bootcamp with Xandy]])

When you dance, you can enjoy the luxury of being you. [^2] 

Don't try to dance as you see it. Rather, try to see and deconstruct the movement and feel how is it pleasant for your body (listen to your body).  Usually the movement is not as big as you see it (especially with head movements). [^1]

We all have our own journey, everyone is developing at their own pace [^3]

Don't exchange the idea of control for trust. [^5]

Tam, kam dáte pozornost, tam proudí energie. 

> [!QUote] Quotes from [[Jerry Lai]] [^4]
> Do not mistake our progress in learning some skill (dance) for our self worth 
> 
> Watch yourself for signs of addiction. Do you NEED to dance, or do you WANT to dance? Is it negatively affecting other parts of your life that you want to keep?
> 
> Having a great dance connection doesn't mean anything other than that. Asking is sexy. Don't assume.
> 
> Ask your teachers WHY, and use their answers to determine what you keep. Seek curious teachers that are forever student
> 
> 1:1 Ratio for Learning : Integrating. You'll never watch those videos you took half-assedly... so spend the better to practice/integrating it into the body right after.
> 
> It's going to be a lesson on LETTING GO. You have no control over anything other than your own body and your reactions. The sooner you realize that the happier you will be.
> 
> Teaching is one of the most effective forms of learning that you can do.
> 
> Cross-train. A lot of the problems you're having are not solved through more Brazilian Zouk classes. Mobility. Yoga. Rock-climbing. Movement. Strength Training. Contemporary. Tai Chi. Gaga.

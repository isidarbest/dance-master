## Playing with Phrasing

> [!example] Song
> [[Robin Thicke - Lost without you]]

1. Let them find a repeating musical pattern in the music (8th Tum čik čik)
2. Stopping on the pattern and only transfering weight
3. Try to stop with reverb (controlling your movement before the stop and then going as slow as possible)
4. Show them some examples in different positions

> [!example] Song
> [[Can Atila - Mara Despina]]

1. Stop every time she stops singing (later it is only instruments) - third Tum čik čik, with slowing down on two bars

> [!example] Song
> [[Feverkin - Overthought]]

1. We can try to express first start and finish of the melodical pattern
2. Try to express every tone
3. You can try to change between 1 abńd 2

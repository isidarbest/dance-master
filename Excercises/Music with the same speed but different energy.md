## Music with the same speed but different energy

Každou písničku projet celou a až pak jít na další, nezapomenout ukázat naši verzi!		

With every song there are the same phases
1. Play the song, let them listen. Talk about:
	1. What feeling do they have?
	2. What instrument or element of the song is giving them the feeling
	3. How tould they express this energy in their body (with their partner)?
2. Let them dance on the song
3. Show them how we would dance on it
4. Describe, what does it do for our body

> [!example] Songs
> [[DJ KRON - Catch and Release]]
> [[Branko - Made of Gold]]
> [[LANY - I.L.Y.S.B.]]
> [[Lemaitre - Higher]]

> [!Question]
> Which song was the fastest? 
> *They are all the same speed, only the instruments and elements of the music is giving you a different feeling.*

## Playing with basics
Always do it like this
- show what we gonna do
- do it all together
- show them tools they can play with

> [!example] Songs
> Gloria_Groove_feat - IZA_-YOYO
> Wixard XO - Nuh Behaviour
> Alina Baraz - Lavender and Velvet
> Alina Baraz & Galimatias - Maybe

### basic step
- we start [[Basic step]] and there try to figure out way how to play with this. Show them what is it made of - just steps. We can use them, to repeat them, back forth..
- do steps just forward and backwards and then show them that they can rotate it
- play one song only with basics

- show them that they can either go just back, just forward or make locks (just transition of weight)
- after the transition we can make wave (show them how to play with it after - you can do some isolations on the spot, ladies can also try to inspire)

### open lateral

First try the movements solo
- we go to open position and in there we try to play, 
	- hip gorilla movement,
	- sway fro side to side,
	- waves or a palm


### lateral

- we stop on the left side, we try to move shoulders up and down and then we try side wave

- let's try to play now, so I don't want to see any patterns, but use the elements we learned and with the help of music use them in a playfull way
- followers can sometimes also try to suggest some movement in still positions, guys try to be perceptive

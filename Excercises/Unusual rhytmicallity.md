## Unusual rhytmicallity

**Song:** [[Ed Sheeran - I see fire (instrumental)]]

Melodic patterns
1_1 / 1_1 2 /3_2 / 4_1 2 / 1 4

First solo then in couples. 
1) clapping or stomping on the beats
2) doing some sharp movement
3) trying to have "reverb" on the movement (moving linear and sharp contrast)

*Try to dance on the song and find the patterns*

show them expressing different notes (most natural will be always 1_1)
REPETITION (the melody often repeats)

[[Can Atila - Mara Despina]]
[[Ashram - Elizabeth]]
[[Woodkid - Brooklyn]]

**Challenge on the end** 

[[Emmit Fenn - Painting Greys]]

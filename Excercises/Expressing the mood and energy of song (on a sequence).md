## Exercise - Expressing the mood and energy of song
In song we can follow several layers of a song
1) tempo
2) rhytm
3) melody, frequencies, singing
4) mood

Last two points are the ones that make the biggest difference in expression of advanced dancers versus intermediate. Also because they are the hardest and least regular of them. 

> [!example] Songs
> [[Lola Jane - Leave you]] or Delacey - Dream It Possible
> [[Pabllo Vittar - K.O.]]  or Duda_Beat - Deixa_Eu_Te_Amar
> MC Lipi - Praiou or DJ Kakah - Delilah or MC Rodolfinho - Velho Ditado or Mc 2K, Igor Sales & Malharo - Cheiro de Rosas

Play a minute from each son and let them dance.
> What is the difference between those songs? What differences you made in your dance to express each of them?

1. Teach them one phrase
2. Let them try on normal music
3. Show them a different feeling of a song, what can they change in general

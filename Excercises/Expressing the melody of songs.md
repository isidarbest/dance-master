## Exercise - Expressing the melody

> [!example] Song
> [[Arianna Grande - 7 Rings]]


1. express only "bells" in the background, ignore rhythm and voice. Express body movement to the side. then add some smooth movement (various waves) and add bells to it. Contrast!
2. the melody is often repeated, has some structure (see phrase)
3. Count, then clap to it. then sometimes try to turn off the music (just the volume) so that they continue dancing
4. Then connect more regular bells (we express both). by moving for each time we express the bells regularly and with some contrast (perhaps using another part of the body) we express what was before
5. **for the more advanced** - we can make a continuous slow movement with the chest and express the emphasis with a faster movement (but everything fluid)


> [!Warning] Challenge
> We can try walking together with the chest movement

### Extra Challenge
> [!example] Song
> [[Emmit Fenn - Painting Greys]]
1. Show them how it would look if I try to express every single note (very noisy)
2. Show them how powerfull it is just to try to express the beginning and the end of a melody pattern
   > Try to relax from the idea of expressing every note, sometimes it is impossible and you wouldn't have a nice dance, but there are always another options, if you catch the beginning and the end (mostly the end!) of every melodical phrase, it will look amazingly and feel also
3. Let them try

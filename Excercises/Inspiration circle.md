## Exercise - Inspiration circle
Everybody stays in a circle. We choose a body part (for example hip movement). Then we play some song or a loop melody and go around the circle. Everyone has to come up with a new version of movement (new version can be also slowing down or making it bigger but there has to be some visible contrast). Teacher is always going in the middle of the circle and trying to explain shortly, how to do this movement. 

>Can be done solo and in couples


## Exercise - Inspiration circle n.2  [^1]
*Every group is going to show us their favorite movement in the end, so you have to choose one. Then when you are ready, you can sit down. Don't forget to try to explain what you do to others, especially when you see someone struggling or not knowing how to lead/follow it.*

- first make a big circle (with us in the center) and show them how it works - tell 3-4 random couples to show us and we all repeat
- divide them into groups from 5-10 people (depending on the size of the group)
- tell each group to choose the most original movement, when all people from the group show one
- when they finish, they sit on a ground (so we know the whole group is finished)
- every group is showing their favorite movement to everyone 

Let them dance one song when they connect some of the movements together with the steps.

## Workshop from [[Paloma Alves]] about using silence in a dance on [[2022-11 Zouk family retreat, Mexico]]
Exercise where we walked around with different speed and when she said we started talking (or making sounds) and when she said silencer we tried to stop. She made us to come closer and closer and make it louder and louder and then stop  It was about the tingling sensation in the body. 

Then we tried to use it in a dance - first connecting on distance, trying to transfer weight together, connecting first with chest and then hug slowly. Trying to use the silence. Keeping eye contact from F (sometimes eyes, more often chest). Then we try to use the combination of silence and sound of movement

> Types of contrasts (for example distance, size of movement, tension, speed)

## Playing with phrasing with theory

![[1691767279113.jpg]]
### Rhythm

rytmus

Začít kreslit, vysvětlit rytmus, vysvětlit délku tum a čik, pustit jednu písničku, aby se na to zaměřili

Pokračovat s nákresem, vysvětlit frázování, pustit hudbu a snažit se to v tom najít, co se změní apod

### Phrasing
> [!example] Song
> [[DJ Kakah - Safe place]]

1. Stopping before the phrase ends
   - We will try to stop always before the phrase ends on the last 4 beats (8 eights) ends on 5,6,7,8 and start on 1.
2. Fluent stoping with a wave
   - Now try to be fluent in the break (end the movement softly and use it to transfer the weight), show them normal wave
3. Changing contrast with the phrase
   - Try to focus on the music change, if the energy is going up, start moving, if the energy is oging down, try to do only slow weight transfer with one step
4. Using the fluent stopping but in their dance 
   - try to dance only simple things
   - show them some examples

> [!example] Song
> [[Robin Thicke - Lost without you]]
1. Stop on a melodical change in music, start on the beginning of new phrase
2. Use the melodical change to make some fun element that we gonna show them (for example chest movement) with the rhythmicality of the melodical change
3. Try to use the same logic but with any element they choose
   - first they try and then we show them some examples
   - as a challenge they can always try to do something different
4. Leaders just stop and let the followers do anything and then they start
5. **Challenge** for F: Every time they have to create something different
   > very good in the end of some lesson because it brings lot of laughs

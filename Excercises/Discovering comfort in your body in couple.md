## Exercise - Discovering comfort in your body in couple

## Exercise - Discovering comfort in your body in couple

**Song:** [[Ed Sheeran - I see fire (instrumental)]]

play whole song, so they can explore more options

### 1) Exploring the options
they need to express it with different parts of the body, express is as they feel
choose a posture that is comfortable for you (hug, or a bit further away), let the F choose!

- head + shoulders (headmovement)
- chest ((chest movement) - no hips or head
- hips
- steps

Switch roles

First ask them, what options they found and if follower helped them to discover something new, then show them new options

First we show them one movement, then they repeat it, then we let them practice part song just one part of body

### 2) Being aware of the options
show them options with each bodypart
*ledaers, if you don't know the movement, ask the follower, maybe she knows it and she can help you in that*

- head
	stopping of headmovement, "rolling" in the back, movement only with shoulder or with head in chicoque
- chest
	stopping, or circle, or small waves, palma (jen hrudník)
- hips
	swaying, circles, "wave" to the side, small wave

>Talk about impulse versus linear leading

==If there is time==
- steps
	transfer weight, not completely, stop movement, return movement, slow down, speed up, go lower

### 3) Using the music
We gonna play one loop of the song all the time on repeat and they have to find a "sequence" from all parts of the body that will fit to the music. 

*Try to analyse your movement and remember how you do it, try to always do it the same way, or at least the same movements. Analyzing yourself is big portion of becoming musical and creative*

1) L are trying to duplicate their sequence with several F
2) L are trying to describe to the F, what are they dancing
3) F have to describe them what they are doing (they can use their body)
4) F have to try to dance the sequence without L leading
5) **BONUS** - F are trying to dance the same sequence with the next L. So he can feel, how the L before him is dancing and get inspired.

### 4) Positioning

Try to dance the same sequence or at least the same feeling and timing just in different positions.

- hug with different hand on top
- L is going from both sides (first one then another)
- L from behind
- lateral position

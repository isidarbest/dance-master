## Exercise - Get inspired

**Discussion**
*How does your follower inspire you in a dance?
How and in which ways do you take inspiration from your follower?*

### Understanding the hug
> [!example] Songs
> Groundfold - the final chapter
> Justice Der - Don't kill my vibe
> Aquillo - So close to magic
> SYML - Mr Sandman

Leaders close their eyes and girls change. Every time girl comes she chooses how close she wants the leader to be. And guys have to try to feel it and respect it.

Show followers a way how to let the guy know if they are not comfortable with the distance
### Get inspired
> [!example] Songs: 
> [[Birdi - Skinny love]]
> [[Sariel Orenda - Suenos de Libertad]]
> [[Pabllo Vittar - K.O.]]
> [[Sage the Gemini - Watchachacha]]

We put different music every 30 s, they are just in a hug and followers are trying to move their body (no steps) on how they feel the music. Then the guys are trying to incorporate this in the dance (on the spot)

*Leaders, you try to look like you are leading. So from the outside I don't want to see any difference.*

### Work with the inspiration
First the F suggest some moves and mood of the dance (as before), then the L tries to overtake the dance (leading), but with the same feeling and elements as the F started

### Create a different dance
Take inspiration from F - start to lead - create a dance with this mood and style, try to have your dance but incorporate what you felt and "heard" from the F

### Practice
On some random music they can try to do the same only without any instruction on timing. 
*Find some time in the music where you try to give the F some space for expression, she/he may or may not take it. If it happens, take it as an inspiration and continue from there.*

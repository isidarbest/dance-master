Teacher: [[William Texiera]]
Event: [[2022-09 Zouktime! Croatia]]

#### Solo
Everybody alone had to make some pose on 1 and 5 and switch it every time. On other counts they were perfectly still. 

Then instead of stop they will continue the movement in slow mo . So make the contrast on the right count but continue in soft movement. 

#### with partner
The same. First sharp and without continuing the movement . Then with reverb (continuing the movement )
Trying to avoid doing only headmovements (that is our usual tool for expressing the dynamics)

>** idea **
Follower can lead her idea on 1 and follower can do it on 5 (they did it based on my impulse)

Speaking about the communication in a dance. We don't think about it much about leader and follower. We are two people listening and feeling the same music. We cannot talk both at the same time. 

The follower leads the pose and then there is important to communicate! Maybe the follower doesn't have any more creativity for the reverb etc. So just feel yourself together and create the dance 

Based on when we prepare (chicoquote) then it looks different dynamics. If we prepare on 8, then it will have softer feeling , if we prepare half beat before 1, it gets more dynamic

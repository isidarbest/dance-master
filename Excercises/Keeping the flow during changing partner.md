## Keeping the flow during changing partner

Can be used also in any lesson with changing during a training on a song

Leaders are dancing and when I say change, followers are staying int he last movement leader was leading. Leaders are going to another Follower (also with some basic step), trying to adjust to new F steps and continue the dance.

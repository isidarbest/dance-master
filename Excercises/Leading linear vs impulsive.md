## Leading linear vs impulsive

1) One leg in front of other, Bones are stacked, but joints are free, upper body is also free. Partner is pushing F from 0 to 10 gradually and the F is trying to transfer it to the ground. She just receives the energy and sends it to ground, not pushing to the partner (no contra resistence). She is trying to have the posture a little bit leaned forward just by positioning the pelvis a bit back.  (More important is the posture than where I have the weight - I can have weight fully on my one leg, but if I have wrong posture it will not work)
2) Trying to give F certain amount of energy so she/he moves only certain amounts of steps (they go into pair of couples. One couple always show with hand to the other couple, how many steps he wants to lead. If he succeeded the other side is clapping)
3) Try to connect the same thought to a body movement (so F goes only half of the wave)

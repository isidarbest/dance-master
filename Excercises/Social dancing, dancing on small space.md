## Social dancing, dancing on small space

We stand in very small space (that is very important). Couples create a circle. There are several exercises we can try.

1) Roda (like in tango). We always try to move forward. L react on a movement of the L before them. 
   >this makes them do simple things and concentrate on the dance as general
2) Dancing on a spot, they can look around and when they get eye contact with another leader, they switch places with each other. 
3) The same thing as before but also with changing places they have to change also partners.
4) It's possible to do the same on the whole dancefloor (but then it is needed to talk about "stealing" partners in a dance)

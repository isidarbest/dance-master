The first factor I will call EMBODIMENT. It is the way your body moves at any time as the result of your personal history, your life, your activities and your psychological state. Your body has grown into your current life much like a tree adapts itself to the surrounding conditions. In Western Europe, for example, most tango people have intellectual background and their professional activities demand to sit long hours in front of a computer. Such a lifestyle results in a tense shoulder area, forward protrusion of the head, inflexible pelvis and weak legs: just about the opposite of what is needed in dance.

You cannot be tense and move sensually. You cannot be tense and dance elegantly, or play, or make love with abandonment. Tension is not only the opposite of movement: it is also the opposite of joy

Your embodiment is further defined by your psychological state, your sense of self as a unique separate human being. As Alan Watts wrote “I have discovered that the ego is a chronic and habitual sense of muscular strain”. A lot of tension in our muscles is the result of our ego-related anxieties. Mindfulness meditation or simply being in a happy mood makes your body more relaxed because you loosen up the tightness inside yourself that you unconsciously associate with this feeling of “me” and what this “me” represents.

The more you move in awareness of how you move, the more you will improve the way you move, and the better you move, the better you will feel physically and mentally.

A beautifully moving body is naturally toned, holds itself upright without effort, finds balance easily, its posture and gait are anatomically efficient, its movements are smooth and harmonious. Such a body is highly reactive, spontaneously adequate in its reactions and generally relaxed, meaning it is free of tension. Tension is the opposite of movement and therefore the enemy of dance. If one part of your body is holding itself in a tensed position during the dance it will spoil the visual impression, no matter how masterful you are in your steps

beautiful dancer also keeps his or her energy flowing. This does not mean you should be visibly moving all the time, but even when you are standing completely still you should “continue to vibrate”, as one of my ballet teachers said. “You can always tell a dancer who vibrates from one who is just standing there.”

Beautiful dance looks like flying, not like moving furniture

A beautiful movement is one that makes meaningful lines in space. This means that each movement has a certain given trajectory, logical within the whole. Dance is what happens while you are creating those lines with your body and it comes down to HOW you create them. Making beautiful lines means completing each movement’s trajectory fully. [^1]

When in despair, remind yourself that aesthetics do not just happen, they need to be trained

PRESENCE. You can always tell when a dancer is working hard, stressing about the result, executing a routine or when s/he is truly dancing. “Becoming” dance is what ultimately dance is all about and it means to be fully present in what your body is doing, at once being the dancer and letting the dance happen through you. For this you will need to concentrate your full attention every time on here and now and completely, consciously, abandon yourself to the dance. If

It's important to remember that there is no musical genre called "Brazilian Zouk". What really defines "traditional music" is not some specific genre but how the music feels and body responds to it. Typically these are songs with soft, rounded and steady beat that creates the characteristic pulse. That pulse is what guides the body's movement.

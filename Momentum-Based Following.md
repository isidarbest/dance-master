> [!definition] Definition
> The follower continues a movement trajectory, initiated by the leader, until a **limit**—internal or external—stops, redirects, or transforms that movement.

## Types of limits

| Limit type            | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Anatomical (internal) | Follower reaches the physical boundary of her body position. |
| Partner-based         | Follower is stopped by the frame of the leader on her body.  |
| Enviromental          | Spatial constraints, floor, walls, other dancers...          |

**Anatomical limits should always be respected in relation to a healthy, aligned** [[Basic posture in dance|posture]] (i.e. the shoulder shouldn't go out of its position, the body shouldn't lean forward etc.) and to the most relaxed and elastic version of [[Frame in zouk|frame]] in that position.

[[Zouk rhythms]]

## [[Lateral]] in RnB Rhytm

**Options for leaders:**
- Stepping next to the leg
- Crossing second step to the back
- Not doing the second step  (just two slow steps)

## Teaching RnB to beginners
- start solo [[Basic side step]] with cross to the back, first trying only on 1 long step and 3 step next to the feet 
- trying two rhythms - taaa ta ta (1, 2 and half, 3) and ta ta taaaa (1,2,3) - further mentioned as RnB rhythm and inverted RnB
	- shoulder line in the same hight all the time (balancing with knees and ankles)
	- very sharp step on 3rd beat, stop my movement afterwards completely (later there can be a small reverb after the stop)
	- third step very small, trying to stay with body front
- leading a back step to the follower in [[Basic side step]]
	- same principal as [[Viradinha]] but with lower body, we rotate our hips and through our frame F feels it
	- the more sharp step we doy the more clear we have to be in our frame


Trying [[Dance/Elements/Lunge]] in inverted RnB rhythm. Important to connect it together with preparation. 
- after preparation I am turning on the spot with first step. Second step is also almost on the spot 



From teaching with [[Moni Něničková]]
Simple sequence: 
[[Dance/Elements/Lunge]] > [[Boomerang Reverse#Clasic Reverse Boomerang]] (in the end they can do side basic step) in RnB rhythm

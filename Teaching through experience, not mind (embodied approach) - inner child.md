**Traditional approach:**
The instructor explains — the student executes. The process is led by words and correction.
*Put your right foot forward.*

**Embodied approach:**
The instructor creates a _situation_ for discovery. Concepts are named _after_ they are felt.
*Take a step as you walk towards someone you want to hug.*

## Teaching through inner child
Our goal is to try to speak and act towards the **inner child** of our students. To wake up curiosity, playfulness, imitation and the trust that our body knows what to do. 

**Adult mind** operates through logic, instructions, corrections. It thinks that it needs to understand the movement before it can execute it. 

Adult mind often approach dance with:
- performance anxiety (*“I’ll do it wrong”*),
- overthinking (*“Am I on the right count?”*),
- self-consciousness (*“How do I look?”*).

Our role as a teacher is to help the adult mind temporarily switch off. 

> The most embodied and natural way to learn is to first let the inner child explore and play — discovering what feels good in the body — and only then invite the adult mind to give names to what the body has already understood.

|                   | Adult mind      | Inner Child            |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Learning Path** | Understand → Do | Do → Feel → Understand |

It can be sumed up into two steps: 
1. _Somatic discovery_ — body-led exploration creates intuitive understanding.
2. _Cognitive integration_ — language and naming consolidate that experience.
## Language of the instructor
- using more methaphors and feeling based approach 
	- *imagine you are moving through a water*
- sensory prompts 
	- *How do you feel in this movement?*
	- *Where in your body you feel the tension?*

**Avoid:**
- technical description of the movement too early before your students experiences it in the body
- too much correction during exploration (can disrupt the flow of exploration)
- evaluation as *right* or *wrong*. You can use wording as *let's try different approach/version now*

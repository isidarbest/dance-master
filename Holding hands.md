## Basic embrace
### Follower
- trying to read information from leading mainly with left hand on leaders back (or back side of his arm/shoulder)
	- hand is not dead, it is trying to be active and aware all the time
	- arm is resting on leaders frame (not pushing!)
- right hand has the same tension as when we are holding hands with our life partner during walk.
	- it is uncomfortable if the hand is sloping and leader has to hold it with more tension
	- trying to close the hand so it can relax more
#### Don't do
- pushing partner either with left hand towards you or right hand down (or giving it too much tension)
### Leader
- with right hand trying to catch the shoulderblade of our partner
- when we come to the embrace, we are offering our frame to the follower

## Close position 

## Open posture (lateral)
### Follower
- try to use only the first part of your fingers to create tension (closest to the hand)
### Leader
- offering his hands
### Both
- out hands should be lower than our elbows
- the feeling of frame should be like holding a grapefruit under our arm
#### Don't do
- use thumbs for holding!!

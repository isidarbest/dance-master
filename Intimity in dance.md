Why are there so many interactions in zouk that are misinterpreted as sexual or that they should lead to something? 
> Maybe one of the main reasons is that we (men especially) used to have so much intimacy in our life and not in many forms. We are used to  [[Intimacy|intimacy]] = [[Sex]], but there are many forms of intimacy. Thanks to dance we are able to feel this intimacy first hand and it can blow our minds. Wow, I have never experienced something like this, this has to be something special and I should pursue it.

I already went so long way in a dancing that I can enjoy only the connection, only the intimacy we share in a dance. And that does not have to be the same intimacy we would share on our way to some relationship or sexuality. And in the same time it can be. 

There was a point in my way where I took every intimate connection as "that could lead somewhere" and also used to [[Clinging on things|cling]] on the person instantly. Creating automatic pressure on the connection which was causing more of disconnection than what I was eager for.

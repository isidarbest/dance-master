## How can you understand headmovements?
There are only two headmovements
1. Spine circumduction (circular movement) - bala
2. body rotation

I do spine circumduction, stop it on the side, start rotating body - it's tilted turn


roasted chicken is the combination of 1. and 2. in opposite direction in the same speed

half of head and twice as much body - side to side chicoque (zarážka)


### Pure heademovements
only 1. or 2. alone
only 1. - balao
only 2. - tilted turns

### Mixing but in the same ratio
toale (same direction)
roasted chicken (different direction)

### Uneven compound headmovements
Mixing differet directions and different ratios


> We can stop headmovement in any point BUT in the beginning the safest is to end up in the sides or down. Back is the most vulnerable position


Then we can add the movement of our legs.
We can do it with 
- moving in the straight line (linear displacement)
- follower is going around leader
	- same direction of body rotation
	- opposite direction of body rotation


For example tilted turns 
- turning follower on the spot
- leading her in the straight line (traveling turn)
- leading her going round me but in the opposite direction of her turn
- leading her in the same direction of the rotation


## Follower technique

### Turning on the place
- using only external rotation of my foot that is in the direction of the rotation
	- it turns in the direction I want to rotate to

### Turning while having some displacement 
They use some ballet technique called shane?

Legs keep the same distance and we just keep turning (kružítko)

The more displacement I have, the further apart follower has her legs
 > Boomerang has big displacement so it's small distance

### Turning around partner
Going to the same direction as the turn
- I have to turn more than just half so I can rotate around partner

Going to the opposite direction 
- easier because F can make steps less than half turn

**How to not get dizzy**
You will get dizzy in the beginning
Practising to be in those positions without the movement either to be just on spot or also with walking

**Spotting**
Imagining that there is something very interesting in front of you and you don't want to miss it. And then starting to turn. 
Not using my upper body or arms in order to move the head. Very often followers pull the hand together with the hand.

## Leading 

### body rotation
Horizontal rotate of the body axes

### spine circumduction
Imagining spreading butter on frying pan

## Frame
What is frame?
Guide for dealing with forces we are interacting with in the dance. 

Takes in account 
- gravity 
- your body structure
- dance structure

Bases for the communication between two bodies to become more effective and predictable. 

**Like conversation - when someone says some word it limits the possibilities there can be afterwards in the sentence. This is what frame does. **

Like when I reach for something behind me. First I move my arm and then I move my body (if the hand cannot reach ). We move one part and once we reach a limit, we move the other party. 

Frame is here to help us transmit the movement through our body. If it doesn't come to our body then the frame was disconnected somewhere.
- We can practise that by doing push ups on the wall but we are trying ot be very smooth. Either by inclining on the wall and pushing or away from the wall and pulling 

> We can try the same with people on the classes 

### Types  frames
1. Manequine 
	Elbows are little in front of body and sideways also a bit away from body (lateral). Don't put shoulders up (if I want to stop myself from falling in push up I also don't raise my shoulders)
2. Balerrina
   We use this in open positions side by side

3. Roof frame
	For turns 
	the limit of the mobility is until the hand is perpendicular and in the line of our shoulders and on the other side when the hand is before our forehead.
	for turns or roasted chicken

4. Frame for tilted turns 
Either on the chest or on the shoulder
Elbow of the follower if relaxed.
Hand of the follower is horizontal


In each one of the frames, the line that is created by connecting the fingers of the leader is paralel to one part of the followers body. If I change the line then the body changes.

In manequine the line is paralel to followers collar bones (line of shoulders)

In balerina it connects with the axes that goes forward from the chest

Roof is paralel to the axes that goes from the followers head up

in the tilted turn frame it is connected to the vertical axes of the body

WHen we are leading tilted turns in the tilted turn frame, the hand should be always on the opposite side of axes as the head

![[Pasted image 20230120193030.webp|300]]
That is why it is very hard to do tilted turns with head down, because the hand should be in the back. 


### How do you break the frame?

- giving crossing information that cannot be followed
- giving information that the body cannot follow in that direction

# Class 1
You can organize headmovements only into three movements: 
- Roasted chicken
- balao
- tilted turns
But what about side to side chocique and toalha

### Balao 
mixture of flexion and extension of spine (down and up) and lateral movement of spine side to side, together it is a circumdiction of spine.
First we have to create some strech in our spine and then relax it (instead of collapsing), so there should be any flaps of our skin. If we have space in our spine with stretch, it is safe to do headmovements
> you should always have similar feeling like when you are standing straight even when doing headmovements

How to start balao:
1) start side to side inclination with our chest (we can think about having our head on more horizontal level)
2) keeping the chest in the same place, closing it and opening it
3) Doing circle
If I don't use chest going back, I will use the flexibility only of my neck. Using more mobility of our chest

When we are opening chest, we can think about someone puhing the middle of our back forward, not bringing our shoulderblades together
#### Leading 
When leading balao, Lui showed example on plate (her shoulder line) and apple rolling around (head of follower)

### Tilted turns
- We usually use the higher shoulder (that is the easier) if the turn is without holding the hand (just contact on shoulder). Usually we are pushing with the turn
- when the head is forward usually we use the shoulder in the outside of the rotation

Balao - tilted turn - Balao (turns with connection on F shoulders)
- most common is doing it with head tilted on the side and continue with balao the same direction as the turn
- but it can be done in either direction and with head in any position (it is just harder and needs more clarity of leading)


Headmovement and body rotation in the same direction = toalha
Headmovement and body rotation in different direction = grilled chicken

# Class 2
In turns in spot we often use footwork Replacing footwork.
1) Moove your foot to the direction of your turn

2) replace the original place of the first foot

Lui says, its the same like when someone calls you from some direction, then your feet do this automatically.

Second idea of footwork is Paddle footwork (also for stationary turns but for higher speed)
- one base leg that does not move from one place
- second feet is paddling on the floor without transfering the weight
Base leg the weight is on the front so it could turn
we are trying to paddle less and less, to train our balance

## Displacement turns - Chanes turns (from [[Balet]]) - postupné točky do prostoru
- every step half of a turn (jako kružítko)
- we can choose how far appart are the legs
- they are saying - imageine that you walk like a penguine (we say kružítko)
- it's good to look at the direction you are going (spotting)

Leaders are on a side of follower, looking in the direction we are going.
The more displacement you have, the further apart are legs, if the rotation is bigger than displacement, then the feet are closer apart

These turns can be led also around the leader. 
When the rotation of the turn and the revolution (rotace kolem leadera) are opposite direction, it is easier for the follower because she doesn't have to turn 180 degrees but less

## Type of frames
### Manequine frame
in [[Lateral]] etc
- elbows little forward in front of the body
- its similar position of when you sit down, where your hands are comfortable
the higher are the elbows, the more engagement I want, the more tension I am giving.

### Roof frame 
(viz [[Lui and Larrisa headmovement Masterclass]])

### How to break frame
1) using the inertia of the body (for example in [[Dance/Elements/Open to the right]]) - it would be too hard to keep the frame in that moment
2) changing the angle of hands
3) if I bring the hands into "empty zone" (center of the body of the follower)

Pleasant positions of frame for headmovement
In the manequine frane With tilt to the side - 45 degrees
![[Pasted image 20240112170116.png|200]]

With the inclination backwards, hands are around shoulders height of the follower
![[Pasted image 20240112170228.png]]

Also when going up and down, the hands are going a little bit towards the body of F (because the distance shortens)

If there is a lot of space from the leader, follower can choose to use more inertia of the movement (keeping the flow of energy through her body). If there are constantly some information from leader, it is not easy.

In tilted turns, the hand of the leader is on the opposite side of the head of F

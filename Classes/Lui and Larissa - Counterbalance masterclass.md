colgado - counterbalance pose from [[tango argentino]]
they learned a lot of tango techniques of counterbalance

## Definitions  
Colgado (hanging)
- closer bases, further body, connection by traction

Volcada (leaning)
- horizontal force interaction
- far bases, closer body
- connection by compression

Planeio / Planada (flow)
- body on top of the base
- mixed adjustment connection

Lifting
- vertical force interaction
- one partner is lifting the other one

## Other
When you are closer to the center, your angular speed is bigger, because you have smaller distance, but same speed as your partner


## Ways of offering our body weight for countrabalance
![[Lui and Larissa - Counterbalance masterclass-20241106172958772.jpg]]
Sitting
- vertical alignment from head to hips
Cambret 
- upper body gives countrabalance
Leaning
- body aligned straight from head to toes

Stable balance
- when external forces are aligned with the countrabalance (so for example your hips are always returning to the right positions)
- **this is what we try to have**

Unstable balance
- external forces are trying to force you into different position

If F wants to increase to weight she gives to the follower, she moves the opposite direction as the leader. If you want to decrease, you move closer to the partner. 

Follower can accelerate/deccelarate by moving lateral inclination. If she leans to the same direction as she is turning, it will speed up.

Leaders:
every time you are in your back foot, you are in the acceleration paddle, in the front foot it is your brake

The distance of leaders foot towards the followers foot will influence a lot the acceleration. When you put back foot further away it means more acceleration, if you put front foot futher, it means slower. But it is not a distance away from them, but paralell! If I move away, I just reduce the amount of counterbalance.

If I want more speed I can either go more steps and faster or every two steps I increase the amount of rotation (angluar amplitude). They recommend to practise the angular amplitude. 

If I want to decelerate, I can spend more time on my front foot or increase the distance. The same with acceleration.

# Second lesson
⏯ [Masterclass 2 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXM2AcP21r0&ab_channel=DanceUni)

Starting with leaning on the wall
- whole body straight, just shoulderblades touching
- sitting, back straight, feet further away from the wall
- seeing what changes when I go on the ball of the foot - ball of the foot - stronger counterbalance, more weight

Starting with catching hands in cross position like children and start spinning

Hold doorframe and lean back and explore different positions

Feet sandwich
Leader is enclosing F right foot. All feet are touching, cross hands and slowly move backward and lean. Hands are in the center, above the feet. Straight body. Straight legs.  When exiting, leader is stepping back while he is in the center and then bringing follower back to balance and then he can let go.

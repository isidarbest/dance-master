## Beginners
- sólo technika 
- F dělají headmovement, L zapojí rám, ale nevedou, snaží se jen přizpůsobovat jejímu pohybu
- vysvětlit, jak funguje rám v headmovementu

### Going from Balloon on the spot to [[Basic step]]
We start on the left side (from L perspective), the head is going down on 7 (little preparation) and 8 up. In this way we can go 1 back to basic. [^1]

### Headmovement in [[Basic step]]
- first starting only steps on a rhytm on the spot
- doing headmovment on a spot (with keeping the rhytm)
- going to the [[Basic step]] but keeping the head only on 1 left side and 5 right side
- trying to connect it

## What to remember

We are controlling the shoulder movement, not the head!
If we try to control the head, the movement will be too big and too sharp.

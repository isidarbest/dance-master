## Lateral mirror

> [!NOTE] We can dance it both in close embrace or on a distance.

- the same beginning as [[Viradinha]] but in the third step L is turning back towards the direction of next step
- Followers - don't forget to make second step longer (more side) - like in lateral
- having some space between L and F (for one more person), having more circular frame. What helps:
	-  facing each other with our chest (hips are going to the direction of our movement)
	- also we can avoid the boob touch on the side
	- leaders are doing a little bit shorter step than the size they are leading, so they always stay more in the middle

### In close embrace (vkročený)
Steps for leader:
1. L: Straight back 
2. Turn chest right, placing the R foot between followers feet (delayed step)
3. L: still turning to get back into the same position as follower (otherwise leader stays more in diagonal position)
4. R: straight back 
5. L: can be placed next to F right foot (doesn't have to be in between her feet)
6. R: turning to get in the same position with follower

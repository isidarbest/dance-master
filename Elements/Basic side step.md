We start by doing it all solo facing the mirror
1) long side step and chick chick to the feet
2) we imagine that our head is fixed on the rope to the ceiling so it cannot move so much as the body. The body is the end of the pendulum. We try to send the hips to the movement
4) we try to add the step back just straight
5) we turn the hips and do the step futher (just extending the leg back with turned hips)

We try the same thing only facing eachother in couple without holding hands.
Then the leaders offer frame, but not lead anything yet.
*Try to have the same feeling as when you were not thinking about leading it. Just connect your frame a bit more (give it a bit more tension). You make the F move by moving yourself!*

Starting from transfering weight on the L left then together with transfer on right, lower down in the knee and start long step. 

Beginning with [[Dance/Elements/Lunge]], after we start the side step. Most important is to **prepare the long step on the last step of previous element**. 

==Exercise==
Doing the side step, sometimes [[Simple turn]] and back to side step, sometimes go out to the basic.

>  - Important is to make sure they show the difference (if they want to end or continue the movement)
>  - Catching the F as soon as possible after the turn on the back is crucial


We can do it after every [[Simple turn]], we just need to make sure the preparation is clear and we lower down properly in our knees.

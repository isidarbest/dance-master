## Basic ohrádka
- Holding in neutral position and then "add" a bit of tension by L pulling the hands a bit further from each other
- He starts and leads the movement just by moving his own body
- when we finish, we can hold for both hands and turn for L left (under arm simple turn) or we can use the principal of body rotation for turning with L right hand

## Přidání 4 slow kroků


## What can cause uncomfortable feeling for follower
- Leader is going too far away (is not in contact with his body to her shoulder in the end of one pulse)
- Leader is going shorter steps than he leads to follower (thus shortening his frame for follower)
- His left hand can be too low, so instead of shoulder area it is going more on shoulder blades

We can connect it with beginning of [[Soltinho]]

## Stop and go
- mention the "safe zone" on the rib cage of follower
- accepting the follower in our frame like heavy ball ([[Frame elasticity and flexibility]])
- L cannot go too far and they need to rotate their step and chest towards partner

## Elastico hook with follower turn
- L is going straight, hooks his hand over F body and turn her on the way back
- It is connection of [[Elastico]] and [[Catch and release]]

## Elastico going around the partner
L are hollding the left hand the whole time
F are trying to go just straign like in basic step and "fill in" the hand of the leader
- we can go either back to open position or to close position and continue with [[Basic step]]
### Leader turning back + Soltinho
In front position leader is not turning back to facing follower but turning back to follower while going under arm. It is important that he doesn't go too far, otherwise he rips his arm off. Finishing with [[Soltinho]]
### Elastico going around partner to [[Shadow position]]
- L is trying to make the second step behind F's right leg, so we don't kick each other
- We can count Tum-čik-nic, to wait the right amount of time

#### [[Shadow position#Drunken step in Shadow position|Drunken step in Shadow position]]

### Navázání na [[Soltinho]]
- při druhé fázi obcházení zůstane leader otočený zády k partnerce, podvleče se pod svojí rukou a vede jí soltinho

## Explanation Snake

We can imagine our body like separate parts
- head
- shoulders
- rib cage

Each of the parts will get in the finish line (line above our standing leg) in a different time. First it will be our head, then shoulder and then the rib cage. 
- In the [[Palm wave]] it is the opposite

### Leading
Leaders are trying to make the movement of the follower a bit bigger by continuing the movement of their body to their frame - elastically.

If we want to lead mainly by our body, we have to tilt it a lot (without tilting the head together with it) and then transfer our weight almost fully to the other leg with the movement. 

We cannot lead [[Balloon]] directly from snake, first we have to go to [[Palm wave]] (to passive headmovement).

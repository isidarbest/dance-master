Pohyb dozadu ve vlně - jak skokan o tyči, který přeskakuje zády [^1]

Při vlnách dopředu pomáhá představa plavání prsou nebo zapínání svetru [^1]

## Legs
When we go forward, we are going on a straight (not locked) leg, when we go back, the back leg relaxes. When we go front, the feeling is like the leg is lifting us up. 

We are trying to not get front knee futher than our foot.

We can see it as different stages of one move. When shoulders are going to the stage 1, head is already in stage 2. And they are chasing each other.

> We can also explain it more geometrically - set up a line before the body, first head goes there, then chest, then hips 


## Bodywave in movement
### From [[Basic step]]
L is starting to lead the wave a little bit before the second step (we can say to the beginner that on the second step), otherwise there is a small preparation with closing the chest beforehand. 
- L is waiting in the second step with chest up and doing third step together with F, letting her finish the wave. He has to make the space a bit larger with his frame (because his body is not finishing the wave)
**Steps:**
Forward, to the leg, forward
### From [[Viradinha]]
The timing for the leader is the same. We have to be careful to
- start leading the wave only when the F is facing us with her chest

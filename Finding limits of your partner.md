One partner is receiving. Lays on the ground, the other person is trying to let him feel the weight of their own body. To lift their legs, move them in very simple movements. Listen to the body of the laying person. Trying to help him by listening his limits. **You can find limits only if you are very soft**. Helping the person to notice - if we feel they hold some muscle tension, ask him if he knows it, that there is a tension. [^1]

Don't see the limits as something limiting you, but expanding your options towards certain direction. Like putting a pipe in the water. [^2]

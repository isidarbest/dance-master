## 1. The Origins of Zouk Music and Its Meaning
People from French caribbean islands wanted to create some music of their own, that is why zouk was created. Zouk was inspired by many other dance styles like kompa, carimbo and others. 

The term "Zouk" originates from Antillean French Creole and translates to "night long party." This term was popularized in the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, where Zouk music first emerged. In the late 1970s, the band Kassav’ played a crucial role in defining Zouk as a music genre, blending Caribbean rhythms with contemporary sounds. Their song "Zouk-la sé sèl médikaman nou ni" ("Zouk is the only medicine we have") helped Zouk gain widespread recognition across the world.

Then came Zouk Love and Zouk Béton. 

Semba, Kuduro, Taraxxo, Kizomba came from French people that heard the french carribean islands zouk music and started to mix it into new styles. 

Ghetto zouk is coming from Cape Verde (didnt understand this word properly)
## 2. The Birth of [[Lambada]]
Before Brazilian Zouk, there was Lambada—a dance style that originated in Brazil in the 1980s. Lambada was heavily influenced by folk dances such as Carimbó and Maxixe, as well as foreign styles like Forró, Merengue, and Salsa. It was characterized by fast, intricate footwork, circular movements, and the distinctive close embrace of partners.

Lambada music, popularized by bands such as Kaoma, quickly spread internationally, particularly with their hit song "Lambada" in 1989. However, as the Lambada music trend faded in the 1990s, dancers sought alternative music genres to continue dancing in a similar style.

The name came from the word *gitahada*  (slap on the guitar) - when the DJs in clubs wanted to wake up the crowd. Lambada in portuguese means also *slap*.

Lambada became very popular with the band Kaoma which tried to make lambada the hit of carnival and that also helped the lambada to spread worldvide. In Kaoma there were only two brazilian people. Kaoma was playing mainly in Paris. Then the music was brought again in Brazil.
## 3. The Transition from Lambada to Brazilian Zouk
Lambada died a little bit with a movie called "Forbidden dance" that introduced lambada as a dirty dance that you should never dance. 

As Lambada music became scarce, Brazilian dancers began incorporating slower and more melodic Zouk music from the Caribbean into their dance. This shift began in the mid-1990s in Rio de Janeiro, particularly at the Ilha dos Pescadores nightclub. At the forefront of this transition were dancers and instructors such as Adilio Porto and Renata Peçanha, who adapted Lambada to fit the rhythms and structure of Zouk music.

This adaptation required modifications to the dance itself. While Lambada was traditionally danced with fast, sharp movements, Brazilian Zouk adopted smoother, more flowing transitions. The steps evolved from the Lambada basic step into movements incorporating elements of Bolero, Samba de Gafieira, and Tango, leading to the unique style we now recognize as Brazilian Zouk.

Brazilians also started to dance on music that was played on radios and from there new styles got created.
## 4. The Development of Brazilian Zouk Styles
As Brazilian Zouk gained popularity, various styles emerged, each bringing a unique approach to the dance:

- **Traditional Zouk (Rio-style Zouk):** Maintains the original elements of Lambada with some modifications to accommodate Zouk music. It can be danced both linearly and in circular patterns.
- **Lamba Zouk (Porto Seguro Style):** A high-energy variant that retains more of the original Lambada elements, characterized by fast-paced footwork and head movements.
- **Neo Zouk:** Created by Mafie Zouker, this style focuses on contemporary musical influences, often danced to electronic and chill-out music.
- **Soulzouk:** Developed by China (Xina), this style emphasizes biomechanics and body awareness, allowing for more organic partner connection.
- **Zouk Flow:** Introduced by Arknjo, this style incorporates elements of hip-hop and urban dance, focusing on natural movement and rhythm.
- **RnB Zouk:** From Renato Veronezi 
- **Contemporary zouk:** Xandy and Evelyn, Pasty and Josta influenced a lot 

Also thanks to Mafie and other DJs, people started dancing longer together, because he had longer songs and was mixing a lot. 
## 5. Brazilian Zouk’s Global Expansion
By the early 2000s, Brazilian Zouk had spread beyond Brazil, with dance communities forming across Europe, North America, and Asia. This was driven by traveling instructors, international dance congresses, and the internet, which allowed dancers to share videos and teaching materials globally.

In 2006, a significant meeting was held at the Minas Zouk Congress in Belo Horizonte to unify the global community under a common name. After much debate, the term "Brazilian Zouk" was chosen to distinguish it from the traditional Zouk dance of the Caribbean.

## 6. The Role of the Brazilian Zouk Dance Council
In 2014, the **Brazilian Zouk Dance Council (BZDC)** was established by prominent figures such as Larissa Thayane and Kadu Pires. The council aimed to support and promote Brazilian Zouk worldwide, setting competition standards, ranking systems, and fostering the growth of the dance community.

In Antillean French Creole, Zouk means party! 


Brazilian Zouk Rio de Janeiro Style is a couple dance that is coming from mix of Lambada / Bolero / Samba de gafieira / Tango / salsa / hip hop and others inspiration ....  
The name Brazilian Zouk is used to distinguish the dance from the Caribbean Zouk dance, which is historically related to, but very different. The 2 dominant lines inside of Brazilian Zouk are Zouk (Zouk Rio Style) and LambaZouk ( Porto Seguro Style ) and we have anothers ways to dance our Zouk ( Zouk Rio Style ) with different styles let me try to explain you.

Zouk (Zouk Rio Style )

Jaime aroxa brought lambada to Rio de janeiro in 1988 the sucess of this dance was great .  
We had so many places to dance , we have so many people at old ( Roxy Roller da Lagoa) the biggest dance place of lambada in Rio de janeiro , was amazing place with more the 2000 people dancing lambada .  
We had 3 special groups of dancers in this time , jaime aroxa students , Carlinhos de Jesus students and a favela .... yes Favela was one small group of dancers that called Lamba 7 ( Aipim / Mandioca / Plinio / Pinguim / Felipe / Buiu / Adilio Porto) my name in my group was captain Bolero because they already saw that i was not dance only lambada , hahahhahah , i was dance already one mix of lambada and ballroom dance Brazilian , of course that my lessons of ballrom dance with jaime arouxa already start to change my dance .  
After the big sucess of lambada in Rio de janeiro , where we had alot of lambada places amd many many dancers, start to be difficult to dance lambada because so many things happend and so many people stop the only place that we had was Ilha dos Pescadores .

Zouk Rio style was first developed in Ilha Dos Pescadores in Rio de Janeiro around the mid 90's when Lambada songs stopped being composed and we start to use gipsy king songs and Zouk music .Adilio and Renata was teachers at Jaime aroxa dance school and dancers of Bolero , Samba , salsa , Tango , Ballet and Lambada , so after jaime aroxa stop the teach Lambada , they start to teach this amazing mix of dances and they start to call the Zouk and the first lessons of this new dance was developed and first taught by Adilio Porto and Renata Peçanha Full in Brazil's most famous dance school Jaime Arôxa. They danced to the slower music of the Caribbean Zouk , Gypsy kings and some others sonhs similar to hip hops and rnb songs .this making it easier to learn and vary steps, moves, patterns and combinations. The characteristic steps that were created are the basic step going front and back (from Samba de Gafieira), the opening and lateral step (from Bolero), elastic and bonus (also called boomerang in Europe). Viradinha , Raul ,Soltinho and others steps.  
Since adding lots of new steps and changing the characteristics from Lambada, a new name was given to this dance, another things that made Adilio and Renata change the names was because the real dancers of lambada was not more accept that adilio and renata call this dance of lambada , because was already another dance and as well because the music that was playing at ilha was Zouk , alot of dancers start to call the dance the zouk .the name give was originally 'Zouk Love', later just called 'Zouk'. Today we are calling the Brazilian Zouk for not have problems with the zouk dance of France, Martinica and Guadalupe has changed the name has been given to the dance that was first tought by Adilio and Renata in the beginning of the 90's, which is now didactically used all over the world.

Unlike salsa, which is led with the hands, Brazilian zouk is led by more parts of the body. Sometimes, in a basic sideways movement, it is the hips that move first, followed by the rest of the body, and this is part of what makes the dance so sensual. However, in various moves the dance partners are also connected by eye contact, legs, arms, shoulders, head, etc.

When practicing zouk in dance classes, teachers generally warn women to be very careful with their backs and necks, as two of the most distinctive and commented-on movements are the cambré (arching backwards to a greater or lesser degree, sometimes even below the waist) and the specific 'hair movements' or ' head movements' for the woman. If not done properly this could lead to injury.   
Zouk Rio Style got really strong outside of Brasil more the 50 countries and almost 200 cities are dancing ....

[[Lambazouk]]
LambaZouk, also called the Porto Seguro-style, is often thought of as the evolution of original Lambada, although in its current iteration it has divulged far from original Lambada. This dance is characterized by high energy (energia) and feel good attitude (alegria). Although it is a fast and energetic dance, it flows smoothly and the moves are continuous and rhythmic, and dancers follow circular (and to a lesser extent slot-style) movements as they relate to each other. One way in which the present LambaZouk differs from the original Kaoma-like Lambada style, is that they have removed wiggling shoulder movements (also sometimes seen in Cuban-style salsa). Instead the shoulders are kept fixed while the hips move (swing) to create a sensual effect. A number of movements have been added to the modern version of this dance mainly created by Didi Santos of Brazil.

LambaZouk is characterized by the following movements:

Head movements (Cabeça - head moves in the same direction as shoulder; Boneca - Head moves in the reverse direction as shoulder for half measure (1-2-3))  
(Hair) whip movement (Chicote)  
Back arch/dip (Cambre)  
The original Porto Seguro style is also unique in the way steps are performed to music (in this sense it is closer to Lambada). Here, the steps are performed with equal emphasis (same amount of travel) on strong beat and the two beats that follow (including the pause after the strong beat). This is done specifically to facilitate musicality by matching sharp movements (Chicote and Cambre) with the strong beat. When danced this way dancers fluently incorporate sharp movements to accentuate strong beat without stopping the dance (pausing to catch up). Even though this timing is popular in LambaZouk it is by no means exclusive. Many LambaZouk dancers also dance by taking longer step (or turning the follower) on the dominant beat (like Traditional Zouk). It is also a common practice to switch between the two timings within the same song (by doing multiple contra-tempo turns for the follower). For comparison on timing, Traditional Zouk emphasizes strong beat by having dancers take a long step on the strong beat. In LambaZouk style (as explained earlier) a popular way is to step equally (length-wise) on strong beat and following two beats. This creates continuous movements.

LambaZouk is danced to rhythmic, up-tempo music (tempo is generally fast or medium, rarely slow), whereas Traditional Zouk is more suitable for slow tempo music (often with long pauses). Kizomba music is very popular in LambaZouk owing to its rhythm and pace. Because the music faster, and head movements are more sophisticated and done more often, dancing LambaZouk requires better technique and timing in order to perform head movements without injuries.

LambaZouk is mainly danced in Porto Seguro, São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Argentina, Spain, UK, Israel, the west coast of the US, Japan & recently also in Malaysia. LambaZouk is also evolving to include more modern movements. It is also not uncommon (lately) for dancers to switch fluently between these dancing styles during a single Zouk music song.

☆ Zouk (Rio Zouk Style ) with different styles ☆  
As mentioned above, several new styles can nowadays be distinguished. The dance is changing and developing all the time, adding and changing techniques of dancing, leading and following, but keeping the frame and pattern of Traditional Zouk (Zouk Rio Style). New musics are also part of this development, leading to various new movements and interpretation of the music. Some styles are mentioned here, which are danced now in many countries:

Neozouk - : it's a of Brazilian zouk, that aims to show different trends in zouk , created by Mafie Zouker ( Student by Adilio & Renata), where the gentleman uses his lady as inspiration to conduct his dance exploring every articulation, to define each movement, the difference between conduct and respond is in the direction in which the movement occurs, because there is times when the lady induces the gentleman to a different path , continuing the movement.

Soulzouk - was developed in 2005 by China Soulzouk ( Student by Adilio & Renata) a teacher from Rio, Brazil. Soulzouk, (also called "zouk freestyle" by the inventor) differs according to China from Brazilian zouk in the way it connects with the music.

The Soulzouk dance style is, not only based on the pace, but also on the melody of the song. It can be danced to zouk music, but it is also taught to be danced with a variety of other musical genres, like rap or RnB, that don't have the zouk beat.

We have others new styles from amazing dancers like Renato Veronezi Full , Bruno Galhardo , Jefferson Dadinho , Xandy Liberato that i will try to get more informations from than to write here.

[[Lambada]] was first known in Europe and then it came to Rio de Janeiro. That is where it first changed into zouk love in 1996, took inspiration from [[samba de gafiera]], [[tango argentino]], soltinha (basic folklore dance in Brazil) then the bigger changes came from names like Adilio Porto, [[Mafie Zouker]] or [[Xandy Liberato]]. 
Information by *[[Alex Carvalho]]*


In the 80’s, Lambada was very popular in Brazil and quickly gained worldwide notoriety through its music, especially because of the popularity of the band Kaoma, Beto Barbosa, among others, and different styles of music such as Samba-Reggae, Caribbean Zouk, Flamenco music, mainly Gipsy Kings, among others. TV shows, films and DJ’s also helped promote the dance and the music.

[[Lambada]] was a dance that dominated most nightclubs in Brazil, especially in Porto Seguro, São Paulo, Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro.

[[Lambada]]'s popularity began to decline in the 90’s, and the remaining lovers began to use primarily Zouk Caribbean music to continue dancing Lambada. During this period people naturally began to call the dance French Lambada, because of the music being sung in French Creole. Following that the community began to call the dance [[Zouk]].

As a result of the Zouk music having different characteristics from [[Lambada]], soon the [[Lambada]] dance began to adapt to the [[Zouk]] music. the dance was naturally modified, acquiring different characteristics in various states of Brazil and some places in the world, creating interpretations and different styles of Zouk. 

The French Antillean Creole term zouk was first used on the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique to refer to nightlong dance parties.
In 1979 Guadeloupean sound technician and bass player Pierre-Edouard Décimus and guitarist Jacob Desvarieux formed Kassav’, the group that integrated the diverse styles of mizik zouk, injected the mixture with a contemporary urban, studio-produced sound, and marketed the new music as zouk. With the overwhelming commercial success in 1984 of the group’s song “Zouk-la sé sèl médikaman nou ni” (“Zouk Is the Only Medicine We Have”), zouk was firmly established as a new and viable Caribbean dance music genre.


There was a time when several names were created making it difficult for the community to promote Zouk dance. Several meetings and debates took place and the community understood that the name Zouk was inappropriate because the dance and music already existed in the Caribbean. 

Around 2006, there was an important meeting at the Minas Zouk Congress (currently BH Zouk Congress) in Belo Horizonte, in order to define the official name of the dance and unite the community. The Brazilian Zouk name was decided by majority of votes. Until 2012, there were many meetings, lectures during dance congresses around the world to bring awareness and popularity to Brazilian Zouk name.

In 2014 the Brazilian Zouk Dance Council was founded by Larissa Thayane and Kadu Pires. The Council serves, supports, and promotes all aspects of Brazilian Zouk. We encourage the growth of this great dance throughout the world. The Council is supported by its board of directors – Gilson Damasco, Renata Peçanha, Alex de Carvalho, Kadu Pires, Larissa Thayane, Jaime Aroxa, Rafael Oliveira, Philip Miha, Rodrigo Delano, and Freddy Marinho.

"History of Neo, Flow and Soul. [^2]

Around the 2000s, after the transition between Lambada and Brazilian Zouk, three styles emerged, more urban and with contemporary influences in Rio de Janeiro, aimed at the experience on the dance floor: Neo, Flow and Soul.

Flow is a set of techniques developed by Arknjo. In its genesis, it was

inspired by fluidity, rhythm, and the state of Flow. It aims to prioritize the quality of contact techniques

in motion to achieve a more comfortable, intuitive, and organic dance. Arknjo is also a music producer and event producer responsible for several memorable parties in Rio de Janeiro keeping the scene alive since the 2000s.

Neo, created by Mafie Zouker, is a trend focused on stylish movements and always looking for new influences and new movements. In addition to Mafie being a pioneer in the creation of remixes for Zouk and ended up creating a new musical aspect when he mixed elements of Zouk Rnb, electronic music and chill out.

China was on the scene since Lambada and in the transition he adapted his style of dancing with shorter and more tanned movements and in the perception that his way of dancing was different, Soul Zouk emerged.

Together, China, Arknjo and Mafie were of great importance in the construction of contemporary/modern Zouk in Brazil and around the world."

A question was posed regarding the origins of our dance. Where? When? Who?
History is important. But great dances are not created overnight by one person, or in one place at one time. These are dynamic, creative processes. In the case of Lambada - and subsequently Brazilian Zouk- we have to look at its creation as being developed from several different dances and movements. Africa gave us many of these movements. One has only to watch the movements of sacred orixá dances, as well as popular African dances such as Lundu, Carimbo and Maxixe to recognize the major dance influences that led to the later crystallization of the early forms of Lambada - including hip and head movements. Forro also influenced the development of Lambada and - according to at least one Salvadoran scholar - so did polka. The point is that before Lambada music arrived, all these aforementioned dances were flourishing especially in parts of Brazil that had populations with African heritage. So the Lambada music and these dances traveled around the country from northern parts of Brazil like Belem and became melded together in certain centers - notably in Porto Seguro where there were spaces for the development of the dance such as the Lambada school in the church square in Arraial d’Ajuda and at the Boca da Barra in Porto Centro. It was in Porto Seguro that the dance began to take real form, with a recognizable style and rules and competitions. Of course, it was danced in the bordellos of Porto, which meant that the dance had a notoriety right from the beginning. But this ‘forbidden’ quality of the dance (which was also present in its predecessors Lundu and Maxixe)  only served to make it more popular. People came to Porto Seguro from many other parts of Brazil to watch and dance Lambada at the famous cabana ‘Boca da Barra’. Eventually Lambada music and dance gained worldwide popularity when the group ‘Kaoma’ was formed to promote it and became enormously successful. I really want to stress that although it may have seemed to Rio or São Paulo dancers that Lambada lost its popularity - but in Porto Seguro it NEVER DID. Bahianos have been dancing this beautiful dance in its purest contemporary form since the beginning - often facing enormous opposition and judgement which exists even today. Dance spaces were burned down, lambadeiros were judged to be immoral and ostracized. Fortunately, the Porto Seguro government has recently declared Lambada to be an important cultural entity. This has only taken forty years!
But if a dance gains sweeping popularity as Lambada did, it will always have to rely on the continued creation of new music. For various reasons known best to the commercial music industry, after the demise of Kaoma Lambada music began to be replaced by different rhythms. Radio stations lost interest and moved on to the next craze. There were still many people who still wanted to dance Lambada but students in Rio and São Paulo became hungry for new styles and new music. Dance teachers in many places were losing money. So it is no surprise that Lambada metamorphosized into a more contemporary form and was repackaged as ‘Zouk’ - which happened to be the name of Caribbean music from Martinique and Guadalupe that had a similar rhythm to Lambada. They renamed classic Lambada steps - Lambada’s ‘Basic 6’ became ‘Lateral’. ‘Diagonal Twist’ became ‘Bonus’ etc etc. But it was still actually ... LAMBADA. People with backgrounds in other dances - Renata Pecanha for example - added touches that brought a Contemporary Dance flavor to Lambada. It started to be danced slower, in a linear rather than circular pattern, more upright and with less movement in the hips, all of which was easier for people with European backgrounds. The more complex and difficult moves of Lambada such as Boneca - which was created by Master Didi and his then partner Rebecca Lang and subsequently developed by Master Braz and others in the Boca da Barra - were left behind. The fascinating ‘Desprezada’ was itself ‘ignored’! Why? Probably because it was considered too difficult for the masses and therefore not marketable. And the ‘Diagonale’ - a basic and essential element of Lambada that creates stability, beauty and an excellent preparation for turns - was also lost.
In reality, no one can be blamed for trying to repackage a beautiful dance, even though it involved a certain amount of ‘dumbing down’. Even the lack of acknowledgement that Brazilian Zouk was, at its foundation, Lambada, was understandable. Less forgivable, in my view, was - and is - the failure to acknowledge the essential African nature of the dance’s foundations and the African origin of its rhythms. Such a shocking omission may have been based in blatant racism.
Of course, some repackaging attempts simply involved renaming Lambada: ‘LambaZouk’, ‘Zouk-Lambada’ and many more. And there was a group of Caribbean dancers who had serious objections to ‘Zouk’ - the first new name for Lambada. People in Martinique and Guadalupe for example already enjoyed a local dance called ‘Zouk’ that was nothing like Lambada. So enter a consortium of individuals who chose the name ‘Brazilian Zouk’ (incidentally that occurred without consultation with the Bahian Masters who had created the original form of the dance).
To come full circle, I want to reiterate that all dances are dynamic; they will continue to develop and change. The developers of Brazilian Zouk were more privileged in terms of education and had better marketing skills than most Bahian lambadeiros so little wonder purer Lambada began to lose ground.
Today the majority of Brazilian Zouk students are young, educated and social network-savvy. The essential street-wise /beach-based/ sassy / extroverted / fast-paced/ sexually polarized elements of classic Lambada have morphed into the now popular and more physically conservative/ androgynous / lyrical / introverted/ trancy forms. And what was intuitive, innate and natural has, in some settings, become far more stylized and the subject of endless verbal analysis. But don’t get me wrong - many beautiful and interesting styles of dance have developed from Lambada, though, and some superb performers and teachers have emerged. And one can only admire the ability of leaders in those fields to engage students as they have done.
These days, Lambada is enjoying a resurgence in the United States and elsewhere, and its original name has been reclaimed. Brazilian Zouk Dancers are interested in exploring more variety in terms of dance ‘energia’ - and it is noteworthy that Brazilian Zouk Jack & Jill competitions in Northern America now comprise a faster section.
There are considerable challenges involved in dancing Lambada well - including the need for heightened musicality at fast tempo, the ability to swap partners and dance with more than one person at a time, extraordinary athleticism, and an acutely exquisite partner connection even without physical touch. Nevertheless, today die-hard Lambadeiros and ‘Lamba’ newcomers alike bask in the pure pleasure of their extraordinary dance, and hungrily seek its fun and potency wherever they can.
For those who have so far been exposed only to more contemporary forms of Lambada - acknowledging the roots of Brazilian Zouk is not only ethically essential; the truth is that understanding the basic forms and patterns of classic Lambada leads to a far better ability to understand and execute Brazilian Zouk. It is no mistake that some of the innovators of new styles - Adílio Porto and Renato Veronezi for example - were originally
fantastic classical lambadeiros.
It seems smart and logical that those who started with Brazilian Zouk should be trying to learn classic Lambada as well, right? After all, its of similar importance as learning Classical Ballet first before attempting Modern Ballet...
And for those of you for whom learning the roots of your dance seems out of reach or too hard, at least take comfort in knowing that- as a Brazilian Zouker - you ALREADY dance Lambada.

Zouklove is danced to slower music and it is a more dramatic and sensual style of Zouk. Zouklove has its origins in a slow tempo form of cadence sung by Ophelia Marie of the Dominica. Zouklove in turn influenced an African genre of Zouk called Kizomba which developed in Angola and Cape Verde.	https://youtu.be/pAiORfHqTfY

Zouk má kořeny v brazilské lambádě a sambě, hudba má kořeny ve Francii a Karibiku. Zoukový rytmus je inspirovaný rytmem z Haiti, stejně jako hudbou nazývanou cadence - hudba z Dominikánské republiky. Karibská skupina Kassav' je považována za zakladatele zoukové hudby v 70 a 80 letech. Zouková hudba začala být populárni v době kdy hudba lambady odeznívala z brazilské scény. Poté, co se přestala lambadová hudba vytvářet, začali brazilci tančit na zoukovou hudbu.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFRXxy5DI8

Kaoma vznikla díky iniciativě francouzského režiséra, který přijel do Brazílie točit film o místní kultuře a lambáda ho tak zaujala, že si koupil práva na některé originální písně a nechal vytvořit tuto skupinu aby se tento tanec rozšířil i do Evropy

Lambadisti začali tančit na zoukovou hudbu díky její podobonosti s lambadovou (poté, co se lambadová hudba přestala produkovat)

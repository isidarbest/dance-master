## Why teaching a couple costs more money
> [[2024-12-18]] jsem učil pár za 1000 + cenu sálu a přišlo mi to jako dobrá cena.

**Enhanced learning experience**
- you are essentially getting two lessons in one session as teacher is instructing and correcting both of you 

**balanced progression** 
- teacher is concentrating on the couple to progress in the same speed together, additionally he can give more tips and details to one person which is more comfortable with his body

**Interaction management**
it takes much more energy and presence to balance the interaction and synchronisation between two people

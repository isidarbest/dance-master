## [[Elvina]] during [[2025-09 Bali embodiment retreat and marathon]]
When I was asking her about our dance she said: *You have a quality that not many people have. If I should name it simply - it would be caramel. Always continuous elasticity that is just so balanced and with the right tension.*
## Andrea Kallab
During [[2025-05 Prague Zouk Marathon Spring]] (french girl). Wrote me on Instagram. 

*Hey Ondrej! Just wanted to thank you again for our dances in Prague, they were transcendental, I have experienced and learned so much in those few hours with you.* 
*I felt you were a guardian of the flow of life in me. Thank you and keep the magic flowing, hope to see you soon!*

I replied:
*Oh wow Andrea, this is so beautiful message ✨💙*
*This is so surprising for me to read that you learned something in our dances. Could you tell me what was that?*
*Apart of the fact that physically and technically our dances were very satisfying (I just love the combination of long steps and intimate close dance), there is definitely a unique magic we shared in our connection. I admire the way how you hold your presence and in the same time there is space for me to share it with you.*

And she: 
*Hiii sorry it took me so long to answer!* 
*I see all my dances as journeys and practices so I tend to learn a lot. But our dances were really initiatory for me, I experienced what it meant to just surrender to the flow of life inside of me, and it was like you were speaking to it so clearly, knowing exactly what you needed to do to invite my body to move.*
*And it was just the perfect balance between leading and following between us both.* 
*I also love how you held the space where there are no mistakes, and just created from what my body was giving you.* 

*At one point I wanted to cry, I felt a lot of sadness to realize that in most of my dances my body is not listened to and even abused. I almost asked you if it was okay to cry and didn’t.*

## [[2024-11 Cedric and Romane Immersion]]
Kristina (which was gf of Abbas I think) told me that she observes me and is really inspired by my flow and the way how I can bring calmness to the dance.

[[Logan Ditillo]] told me that the way how I am grounded especially in some lateral steps and one legged disbalances is an inspiration for him. He was asking me also a lot on the way how I build my creativity. 

## [[2023-09 Bali Zouk embodiment retreat and traveling]]
[[Brenda]] told me that dancing with me requires a lot of her brain power and it feels like every moment she cannot comprehend how my brain works and gets always surprised. 

[[Dan Yamato]] told me that [[Vanessa (V)]] told him, that my dance feels like I let her start the movement and I finish it. And when she was dancing with [[Lui and Larrisa|Lui]], it felt like he is starting the movement and let her finish it. It was very interesting feedback

Scott (boyfriend of [[Elvina]]) told me that it is very pleasurable to watch my dance, it feels royal. Very soft, elegant and effortless. 

[[Kimberly]] told me after the retreat that I am giving a lots of space for her voice in a dance to be heard and also a lot of appreciation when I see it happening. That she has lots of freedom and invitation for her body to move in a way her body wants to move.

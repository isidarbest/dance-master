When your upper body is in the limit of your foot, it is much harder to lose your balance. [^1]

When shifting weight, make sure you are not putting your weight on the knees but on the pelvic floor. [^2]

The body is always searching for balance. What changes is how much tension we add, helping that search. Too much tension makes it harder for body to adjust. 
Most of the time when we are learning dance we don't "lose" balance in the strict sense - we interfere with our ability to recover it.
When our body is out off balance (when the center of gravity moves outside of base of support), body actively works to restore it and seeks equilibrium. 

> [!NOTE] In this way, being "off balance" is better described as being in *state of correction*.

Falling occurs when the body's corrective capacity is exceeded. Many dance teachers frame it as *extension of balance*: the body moves through imbalance and reorganizes upon impact or recovery.

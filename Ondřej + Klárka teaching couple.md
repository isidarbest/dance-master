## Bio
Klárka and Ondra both developed a profound love for music and dance from an early age. Klárka, in particular, found her passion for dancing at a young age, starting with ballet and then exploring various dance styles. Additionally, both of them played musical instruments since childhood. These early experiences formed the basis for their deep emotional connection to the art of dance.

More than 8 years ago, they discovered salsa and bachata, but they soon fell in love with zouk. They were captivated by its beauty and complexity. They focused their development in their hometown dance studio, Stolárna, led by Luděk and Pavla Lužní, and also attended international congresses.

As teachers, they began by organizing workshops on musicality and creativity in Brno, and soon they started teaching internationally in places like Romania and Germany. One of their main goals is to guide local dancers in the right direction and help them understand the essence of dance connection.

Ondra, with his experience as a DJ, shares his passion for music with his students, teaching them how to express themselves and understand the music. Klárka, who has explored various dance styles, brings her fresh and inspiring dance style to zouk. They aim to go beyond the traditional knowledge of zouk, teaching not only movements but also different mindsets that supports creativity and enhance social dancing skills.

## Dance teaching pedagogy
As a dance teacher it is very important to know the reasoning behind the movements, to be able to tell students - this is danced like this because of that. But someone else can tell you something different. In [[Zouk]] there are so many approaches and styles and preferences. 

There is also a [[movement intellect]] which states how fast they can make their body to do something they have in their head or what they see. It is not so important if they understand only with their mind.  

Teachers should be open to say everything to anyone. You are not there to comfort them, you are there to help (for example if someone stinks or is not behaving socially acceptable).

Students are babies, we cannot feed the babies with hamburger (all technique with some elements). How much can babies digest? When the baby becomes teenagers you can change the way you talk to them. [^2]
# Wording
- Never say "relax". Especially in connection with the word "have to". It's impossible to feel relaxing. 
- *Try to not think* is also not working. Instead using the expression *put your attention on...*. Not thinking is a state of deep relaxation which happens very late in a dance journey. Especially if we have some exercise it is not possible to not think. 
# Teaching in dance community

Everything you teach you have to make them feel. 

What is different on teaching in community versus a congress? [^1]
- just a small percentage of people are coming because of a dance. Most of the reasons are different like:
	- get social contact
	- get physical contact
	- having something in common with your partner
	- trying something new/exotic
	- having some body movement in their life

Important aspects of a teacher [^1]
- **quality** (dance technique, competence)
- **social aspect, relationship to people**
- **padagogy**
	- feeling for the level of people we are teaching - giving them what they need and exact amount of information, we are not here to present everything we know at once
	- people come here to have fun and learn, having fun also help them to keep the attention span  

### Teaching beginners
- even when we are showing something to them, we are trying to limit our body, so the movement looks more like theirs (that way they will be focused on the most important parts)
- sometimes we can show them a taste of something very advanced (to keep motivation)
- using simple language so they can understand it better

## Recapping the last lessons
- We can give some responsibility to the students - they can show us or at least tell us something we did last time. If we take all the responsibility from them, they will get used to it and not remember so much [^2]

# Stages of Ecstatic dance
### Arrival: gentle. awakening. graceful. flowy. innocent. stirring.

Arrival tracks welcome the community to the space and the dance floor. They help the dancers feel present, safe, and grounded.  Arrival tracks set the container and create a space to warm up the body and become comfortable in the space. (The tracks often begin as ambient and move into the downtempo realm.)

### Buildup: driving. insistent. throbbing. thrusting. playful. intensifying. rising.
Buildup tracks get the energy moving. The beats are driving and percussive. They help the dancers develop dynamic tension. (Typically, they are mid-tempo.) This stage is when we are starting to build up a sweat and get moving. 

### Peak: wild. surging. chaotic. orgasmic. soaring.
Peak tracks are for catharsis and climax. The beats are assertive, and the bass drops are powerful. (Typically they are high tempo.) Now the dancer has begun to lose themselves in the dance and surrender to the process. 

### Cruise: steady. deep. unwavering.
Cruise tracks are played between peaks, giving the dancers a chance to get recharged. They are the antidote for beat fatigue. They aren’t moving the energy up or down. (They are typically high tempo with temperate beats.)

### Landing: airy. lyrical. angelic. nostalgic. flitting.
These tracks carry the dancers down from the final peak into the heart. This is a period where the body can play freely with a range of style of music –  having spent a lot of energy energy and become very comfortable in a space of movement. 

### Integration: peaceful. still. drifting. fulfilled.
Integration tracks are played at the end of the journey to hold the “beingness” after all the dancing “doingness”. They differ from Arrival tracks in that they feel more emotional, reflective, and resolving. (They are chill and ambient.)

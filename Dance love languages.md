“My favourite music has a nice, strong beat.”

**Want to be known for**: Being the “Fun, Comfortable Partner”

One of the most beginner-friendly types
Often more silly, goofy, or light-hearted than other types
A smile and open body language draws them instantly

“The worst thing is a rough or inconsiderate partner.”
“I have trouble trusting a partner that I’ve had a bad dance with in the past.”

More sensitive to “rough” dancers
Take connection errors more seriously; can be prone to beating themselves up about not following or leading ‘well enough’

#### Challenge Dancer Thoughts:

“I hate it when I see a dancer doing cool stuff with other partners, and then they don’t do any of it with me!”
“I want to try that again; this time I’ll get it!”
“I have a list of concrete dance goals I want to achieve, including one-footed turns, splits, and a really cool dip I saw this one time.”
“I get frustrated if I just can’t seem to make something work.”

## Expression

**Your Pet Peeve**: Dancing the same way, regardless of music.
**Want to be known for:** Musicality and interpretation

“The worst thing is a bad DJ or an undanceable song.”
“I’m just not feeling this music.”
“I wish I could get my body to do all the cool things I think about doing to this song.”
“I love to listen and think about what I can do to different songs at home.”


#### Common Trends:
Being on time is very important (After all, how can you interpret a song if you aren’t on time?)
Likely to be very attached to what music is played, and follow specific DJs or musical tastes.
Might use “bad” music or DJs as their break time.

**Your Pet Peeve:** Only doing what you learned in class
